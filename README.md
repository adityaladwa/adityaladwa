I am a self-taught developer, I have many years of professional experience in android app development. I started in a fintech org <a href="https://www.epaylater.in/">ePayLater</a>, then moved on to build the ride-hailing product of a super-app in southeast asia, known as <a href="https://www.gojek.io/">gojek</a> and currently working as a platform engineer at <a href="https://www.meesho.io/tech">meesho</a>. I strive to produce pixel-perfect, high performing software. In my college days, I created an SMS app that allows user to create polls, I build an android app as a replacement of Computer Science Lab Manual that all students loved and found useful.
